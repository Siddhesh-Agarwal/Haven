## What is Secure Spark?

In recent times, Digital Vulnerability is becoming a huge threat to our privacy.An effort to spread awareness about the effects of Digital Vulnerability is our project Secure Spark.

Our Nation currently requires a robust cybersecurity strategy that safeguards government systems, business ecosystems and most importantly the citizens and this requires in depth knowledge on the concepts of cybersecurity.

Secure Spark enables students to develop their knowledge in cybersecurity with a hands on approach by building projects and simultaneously their portfolio.

Secure Spark's projects have an increasing level of difficulty, starting from the very basics to up to advanced concepts and problems that have real world applications.

Secure Spark's projects are built to be Engaging and appealing to all students.
