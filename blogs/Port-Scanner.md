## What is a Port Scanner?

> When a secondary storage device like a USB is inserted into your device the computer scans for all available ports and chooses one.
>
> But sometimes these ports are not closed and leave you vulnerable to port scanning attacks.

## Why should you use a port scanner?

> Open ports can leave you vulnerable to cybersecurity criminals trying to get to your sensitive information or even having remote control to your device.

## How does our port scanner work?

> Our port scanner opens every port available on your device and records the response time. Based on this response time our system is able to identify the open ports in your system.
