## What is Hashing ?

> The hash value can be considered the distilled summary of everything within that file. Hashing is the process of transforming any given key or a string of characters into another value. This is usually represented by a shorter, fixed-length value or key that represents and makes it easier to find or employ the original string.

## Why do we use Hashing?

> Hashing is generally used to secure sensitive information in a way that is not decodable. Sensitive information like confidential files and passwords are all secured using hashing.
>
> Its also a conveniently check whether two large  documents are similar without having to do so manually as it compresses the size of the documents.

## How does Hashing work?

> Hashing uses math algorithms like Adler, CRC, SHA, ext. to compress the data to a fixed size.
>
> This compressed data is irreversible (Data once hashed can not be unhashed) and unique (No two files in the world are hashed exactly the same - Even if the files contents are exactly the same)
