## Password Strength Meter

> A password strength meter helps us to analyse our password by showing the entropy of our password.
The key aspects of a strong password are the length and combination of letters(both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters.
>
>    $$E = log_2{R^{L}} = L*log_2{R}$$
> Where $E$ is Password Entropy,
> $R$ is size of character pool
> $L$ is Password length.
