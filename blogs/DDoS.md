## What is DoS Attack?

> DoS attack abbreviated as Denial of   Services attack is anchored by a threat actor who uses resources from multiple remote locations to attack an organization's online operations.
>
> Denial is accomplished by flooding the target machine or resources with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.

## How does it work?

> DoS is ranked as one of the top four cybersecurity threats of our time.
>
> This targets devices and protocols that connect the network to the internet.
>
> When a DoS attack takes place, the target experiences a sudden interruption in one or more services as the attack has flooded the resources with HTTP requests and traffic, denying access to legitimate users.
